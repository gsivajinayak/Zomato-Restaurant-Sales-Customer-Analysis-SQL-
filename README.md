# Zomato-Restaurant-Sales-Customer-Analysis-SQL


## 📘 Project Overview
This project analyzes Zomato-style restaurant, menu, food, customer, and order data using **PostgreSQL**.  
We created the full database, inserted the data, validated it, and performed in-depth SQL analysis to understand restaurant performance, customer behavior, and food trends.

---

## 🧱 1. What We Built (Schema Creation)
We designed a complete relational database with 5 linked tables:

- **customers** – customer details (name, age, gender, occupation, income)
- **restaurants** – restaurant info (name, rating, city, cuisine)
- **food** – list of food items (veg/non-veg classification)
- **menu** – connects restaurants + food items with pricing
- **orders** – sales transactions with quantity, amount, and customer/restaurant mapping

All tables include proper **Primary Keys**, **Foreign Keys**, and clean structure.

## 📥 2. What We Did in Validation (Data Insertion & Cleaning)
Using `Data Insertion and Validation.sql`, we:

### ✔ Loaded data  
- Imported all CSV files into PostgreSQL using **COPY** and pgAdmin Import.
- Used sample `INSERT` commands for manual record insertion.

### ✔ Verified data  
- Checked row counts of all tables.
- Displayed sample rows to confirm correct loading.

### ✔ Cleaned data  
- Checked for **NULL**, missing, or invalid values in important columns.
- Removed rows with null `cust_id`, `rest_id`, `order_id`, etc.
- Ensured the dataset was clean and ready for analysis.

## 📊 3. What We Analyzed (Sales.sql)
Using **joins**, **aggregations**, **subqueries**, **CTEs**, and **window functions**, we performed:

### 🔹 Basic Analysis
- Listed all restaurants, cuisines, veg items, high-rated restaurants.
- Filtered customers by age and occupation.

### 🔹 Join & Aggregation Analysis
- Total orders placed.
- Revenue generated by each restaurant.
- Orders with customer + restaurant details.
- Ordered food item details through multi-table joins.

### 🔹 Subquery Analysis
- Restaurants with more than 10 menu items.
- Most expensive menu item.
- Customer placing the highest number of orders.

### 🔹 CTE Analysis
- Top 5 revenue-generating restaurants.
- Total orders per customer.
- Highest-spending customer.

### 🔹 Window Function Analysis
- Ranking restaurants by total orders.
- Cumulative sales over time.
- Running totals & moving averages.
- Row numbering per customer.

### 🔹 Advanced Findings
- Most frequently ordered food items.
- Restaurant with highest overall revenue.
